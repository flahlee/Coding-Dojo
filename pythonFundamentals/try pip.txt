Try pip!

pip install Django- by this command I was able to install packages from Django.

pip List- by this command I was able to see a list of all packages that are installed, including editable.

pip install Django- by adding this command again shows me that all requirements are already satisfied.

pip freeze- in this command pip freeze doesn’t include editable packages like pip list does, but outputs installed packages in requirements format.

pip uninstall Django- by this command all packages selected will be uninstall.

pip show Django- by this command will show all information of the packages installed.

pip search Flask- by this command I am able to see an output with all packages containing the name “Flask” and also a description with that.
